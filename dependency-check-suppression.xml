        This suppresses CVE-2018-1258 which is necessary because of a bug in the dependency-check plugin itself
        and needs to be active until it is resolved: https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/1827
        It will expire on March 1. 2020 to force reevaluation and might be expanded further.
